<p>Goals of Project:
<ul><li>To explore the uses and application of natural language processing and text mining </li>
<li>Apply class ideas to a project about analysis</li>
<li>Expand coding knowledge</li>
<li>Become better at self-teaching</li>
Aims:
<li>Examine a corpus of President Saturday radio transcripts from Reagan – Obama</li>
<li>Discover trends in words choice over time – both by looking at individual Presidents and the group as a whole.</li>
<li>Look at word Frequency for individuals and as a whole</li>
</p>

<p>While examining topics for this project I was drawn back to examples used in class of analyzing text. Professor Mark Liberman took State of the Union addresses and look at various lexical features of the speeches and graphed them. This stimulated my interests in programming as well as computational linguistics and led me to wonder what other large corpuses of documents could be investigated. I began to research for documents and was soon led back to political address. This is because there are often the most consistently and regularly produced. In addition, I thought that data of this kind would be ideal for following trends, as the political landscape is always changing, shaped by local and world events.</p>
<p>Following this, I researched techniques and strategies for Text-mining, topic tracking, and content analysis. While I typically briefly scanned websites general information, two papers specifically provided the greatest insights. Both were read in greater depth. <u>A Survey of Topic Tracking Techniques by Kamaldeep Kaur and Vishal Gupta<u/> provided background on techniques based around this general concept:</p>
